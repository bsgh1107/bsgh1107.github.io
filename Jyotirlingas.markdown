## *Somnath – Prabhas Patan, Veraval, Gujarat.*
Somnath is considered the first Jyotirlinga among the twelve. The name "Somnath" is derived from "Soma" (the Moon God) and "Nath" (Lord or Master). According to the legend, Soma (Chandra), the Moon God, was cursed by his father-in-law, Daksha, which caused his light to diminish. To regain his radiance, Soma prayed to Lord Shiva at Somnath, where Lord Shiva, pleased by his devotion, appeared in the form of a Jyotirlinga and restored his light.  

The Somnath temple has a rich history, being repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt. The original temple is believed to have been built by the Moon God, and over the centuries, it was destroyed by invaders, notably Mahmud of Ghazni in the 11th century, who looted the temple. The temple was later rebuilt, and its current structure stands as a symbol of resilience and faith.  

The present-day Somnath temple  was built by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, in the year 1951. It is known for its magnificent architecture, with intricate carvings and a grand structure that overlooks the Arabian Sea.

Nageshwar is home to the tenth Jyotirlinga temple. According to legend, a demon named Daruka imprisoned a Shiva devotee named Supriya in his city, Darukavana. Supriya's chants of "Om Namah Shivaya" invoked Lord Shiva, who defeated the demon. A self-manifested Shivalinga then appeared, which is now revered as the Nageshwar Jyotirlinga.
