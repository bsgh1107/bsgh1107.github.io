The Dwarkadhish Temple, also known as the Jagat Mandir, is a revered Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Krishna, located in the coastal city of Dwarka, Gujarat. It is one of the four sacred Char Dham pilgrimage sites, representing the western point of the spiritual circuit established by Adi Shankaracharya.

According to tradition, the temple was originally built by Vajranabha, the grandson of Lord Krishna, over the site of Krishna’s legendary palace, Hari-Griha. Archaeological findings suggest that the earliest structure dates back to around 200 BCE. However, the current temple was rebuilt in the 15th–16th century, after being destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1473 CE. It was reconsecrated in 1559 CE by Aniruddhaśrama Shankaracharya.

Architecturally, the temple is a five-storied structure made of limestone and sandstone, supported by 72 intricately carved pillars. The main sanctum, known as the Jagat Mandir or Nija Mandir, houses a striking black marble idol of Lord Krishna in the tribhanga (three-bend) posture. Rising to a height of approximately 78 meters, the temple's spire is crowned with a 50-foot flag bearing the sun and moon, symbols of Krishna's eternal presence.
