# **Journey**
Our journey began on June 21st, 2024, from Pune, where I was staying with my family at my in-laws' place for a few days. We hired a taxi and travelled by road to Nashik, which is approximately 215 kilometers away and takes around six hours to reach.


## 1. Nashik
We left Pune early in the morning and arrived in Nashik by afternoon. Upon reaching, we checked in at the Ibis Hotel, located on Trimbakeshwar Road. The Trimbakeshwar Temple is approximately 25 kilometers from the hotel.

After having lunch and relaxing for a while, we decided to head to Trimbak to offer our reverence to Lord Shiva.
 


## 2. Trimbakeshwar Temple
The Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple, located in Trimbak near Nashik, Maharashtra, is one of the twelve Jyotirlingasâ€”the holiest shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is mentioned in several ancient Hindu scriptures, including the Skanda Purana, Padma Purana, and Shiva Purana.

What makes Trimbakeshwar truly unique among the Jyotirlingas is its linga, which features three faces symbolizing the divine trinity: Brahma (the Creator), Vishnu (the Preserver), and Shiva (the Destroyer).

Behind the temple lies the Brahmagiri Hill, the origin of the Godavari River, often referred to as the Ganga of the South. Near the temple is the Kushavarta Kund, a sacred pond considered the symbolic starting point of this holy river.

Historically, the original temple is believed to have been destroyed during the Mughal period, most likely under the reign of Aurangzeb. The present-day temple was rebuilt in the 18th century by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao, in the classic Hemadpanthi architectural style, characterized by its use of black basalt stone and intricate carvings.

We arrived in Trimbak around 5 PM and were fortunate to receive the blessings of Lord Shiva. Despite having a VIP pass, it took us around two hours of waiting in the queue. However, the moment we entered the temple complex, we were mesmerized by its surreal architecture and spiritual aura. The structure and atmosphere together create an experience that feels truly divine

## 3. Nashik City and Panchvati
We returned to our hotel in the evening and later headed out for dinner to explore some authentic local cuisine at College Road. Known for its vibrant atmosphere, College Road is one of the best places in Nashik to spend an evening, offering a variety of street food and regional delicacies, perfect for food lovers and casual evening strolls alike.

The next morning, we set out for Panchavati, another place of deep religious significance. The name Panchavati is derived from the words "Panch" (meaning five) and "Vati" (meaning banyan trees), referring to the five ancient banyan trees that once grew in the area. It is considered a sacred site, especially for devotees of Lord Rama.

Panchavati holds a significant place in the epic Ramayana. According to the text, Lord Rama, along with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana, resided in the forest near Nashik during their 14 years of exile. The area is steeped in mythological importance and continues to be a site of devotion and pilgrimage.

Nashik also plays host to the Kumbh Mela, one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, drawing millions of devotees. During this event, the Godavari River, which flows through Panchavati, becomes a focal point of worship, as pilgrims take holy dips, believing the water has the power to purify sins.

The Sacred Panchavati Temple Complex houses several ancient temples dedicated to Lord Rama, Lord Shiva, and other deities, where visitors can offer prayers and seek blessings.

We reached the Godavari Ghat area in Panchavati and visited several temples, offering our obeisance with devotion. My elder child, who is just four years old, thoroughly enjoyed taking a bath in the clean, refreshing waters of the Godavari River, adding a joyful touch to our spiritual experience
