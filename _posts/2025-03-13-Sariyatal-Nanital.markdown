# **Journey**
Our journey began on the morning of December 21, 2024, as we set off from Gurgaon, Haryana, driving our own car with the family onboard. We started early to make the most of the day. The route took us through Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Moradabad, eventually leading us to Bazpur. As we continued, we drove through the dense, lush forests of the Himalayan Kumaon foothills, immersing ourselves in the beauty and serenity of the region.


## 1. Nanital
We arrived in Nainital around 2:30 PM and checked into The Palace Belvedere Hotel. After settling in, we took some rest and freshened up. In the evening, we headed to Mall Road, exploring the local market and enjoying a leisurely stroll along the bustling street. For dinner, we visited Brittney's Rooftop Café, which offers a stunning view of the Nainital Lake, beautifully illuminated with lights. It was a perfect spot to enjoy a delicious meal while soaking in the picturesque surroundings. This café is considered one of the finest on Mall Road.

## 2. Sariyatal
Sariyatal is a serene and picturesque lake located near Nainital, nestled amidst the lush greenery of the Himalayan foothills. Unlike the more popular Naini Lake, Sariyatal offers a quieter, more tranquil experience, making it a perfect escape for nature lovers and those seeking peace away from the bustling town.

Apart from its natural beauty, Sariyatal is also significant for its ecological importance. The area is home to various species of flora and fauna, making it a haven for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts. Its serene atmosphere and relatively less commercialized environment make it an ideal destination for those seeking a peaceful retreat in the lap of nature.

The next morning, we hired a taxi early and set off for Sariyatal from our hotel. On the way, we stopped at the Satyanarayan Temple on Kilbury Road, near the Himalayan Darshan Point. This vantage point offers breathtaking views of the Greater Himalayas, their peaks covered in snow. Witnessing this view in the early morning hours was both beautiful and mesmerizing.

We passed through Lover’s Point, where we enjoyed some local roadside delicacies—hot Maggie and tea—before continuing on to Sariyatal.

Sariyatal Lake is a crystal-clear body of water, with underwater flora and fauna clearly visible from above. Boating in the lake offers a unique experience, as the clarity of the water allows you to see the rich underwater life growing below the surface. The area also offers a variety of water sports and activities such as water zorbing, boating, rope cycling, zip-lining, and more.

Just before reaching Sariyatal, in Charkhet, is the Mountain Magin Adventure Park. This is an excellent place for those interested in adventure activities, with options for both kids and adults.

You can also visit the Woodland Waterfall, which is located about 1 km from the lake. This waterfall originates from Sariyatal Lake itself, adding to the area’s natural charm.

## 3. Naina Devi, Nanital
The Goddess Sati’s eyes are believed to have fallen at this location, which gave rise to the name of the temple, Naina Devi. The goddess is also associated with the lake town of Nainital, the Naina Devi Temple, and the crescent-shaped Naini Lake.

Naina Devi in Himachal Pradesh (Bilaspur) is considered an official Shakti Peetha, where the eyes (Naina) of Sati are believed to have fallen.

In the evening, we visited the Naina Devi Temple and sought the goddess's blessings. Later, a friend from Delhi joined us in Nainital to visit the temple as well.

Adjacent to the temple complex is the Tibetan Bhotia Market, where we did some local shopping. Afterward, we went for dinner at Anupam Restaurant in Bada Bazar, a well-known spot for local delicacies and the traditional Kumaon Thali.

## 4. Kainchi Dham, Shri Neem Karoli Baba Ashram
Kainchi Dham is a beautiful, secluded mountain ashram located in the Kumaon Hills of Uttarakhand, approximately 20 km from Nainital. The first temple at Kainchi Dham was inaugurated in June 1962.

The ashram is primarily dedicated to Lord Hanuman and is famous for being the spiritual abode of Neem Karoli Baba, also known as Maharaj-ji. It is believed to be a place of immense divine energy, and over the years, it has become a sanctuary for those seeking spiritual solace and blessings.

The temple and ashram complex at Kainchi Dham is a significant destination for devotees, especially for those seeking blessings from Lord Hanuman for courage, strength, and protection. Neem Karoli Baba is believed to have had a special connection with Lord Hanuman, which is why the temple holds such significance.

Kainchi Dham is where Neem Karoli Baba spent a significant portion of his life and performed many miracles. His devotees believe that his presence at the ashram brought peace and healing to all those who visited.

The name "Kainchi" (meaning “two corners”) is derived from the two sharp turns (corners) of the road leading to the temple. It is said that this unique geography enhances the spiritual energy of the place, contributing to its divine power.

Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, is one of the most famous international figures associated with Kainchi Dham. It is said that he visited the temple in the 1970s during a spiritual journey in India. Jobs reportedly found inspiration in Neem Karoli Baba’s teachings, which influenced his life and career.

Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, visited Kainchi Dham in 2015 to pay his respects to Neem Karoli Baba and the temple, further solidifying the international recognition of this sacred site.


## 5. Back to Delhi
After paying our obeisance at Kainchi Dham, we began our journey back to Delhi, passing through Bhowali and Bhimtal. Along the way, we stopped at a local dhaba named Chullah Mutton, located near the village of Salari. My friend, who had joined us from Nainital, was eager to try the local mutton delicacy. However, since my family is strictly vegetarian, we didn't have anything there.

Just about 1-2 kilometers from this dhaba, we came across a pure vegetarian, home-style cooked food dhaba that serves authentic local dishes. We stopped there for brunch, enjoying a delicious, traditional meal before continuing our journey back to Delhi via Haldwani, Rampur, and Moradabad.
