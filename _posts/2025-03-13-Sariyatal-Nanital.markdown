# **Journey**
Our journey began on the morning of December 21, 2024, as we set off from Gurgaon, Haryana, driving our own car with the family onboard. We started early to make the most of the day. The route took us through Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Moradabad, eventually leading us to Bazpur. As we continued, we drove through the dense, lush forests of the Himalayan Kumaon foothills, immersing ourselves in the beauty and serenity of the region.


## 1. Nanital
We arrived in Nainital around 2:30 PM and checked into The Palace Belvedere Hotel. After settling in, we took some rest and freshened up. In the evening, we headed to Mall Road, exploring the local market and enjoying a leisurely stroll along the bustling street. For dinner, we visited Brittney's Rooftop Café, which offers a stunning view of the Nainital Lake, beautifully illuminated with lights. It was a perfect spot to enjoy a delicious meal while soaking in the picturesque surroundings. This café is considered one of the finest on Mall Road.

## 2. Sariyatal
Sariyatal is a serene and picturesque lake located near Nainital, nestled amidst the lush greenery of the Himalayan foothills. Unlike the more popular Naini Lake, Sariyatal offers a quieter, more tranquil experience, making it a perfect escape for nature lovers and those seeking peace away from the bustling town.

Apart from its natural beauty, Sariyatal is also significant for its ecological importance. The area is home to various species of flora and fauna, making it a haven for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts. Its serene atmosphere and relatively less commercialized environment make it an ideal destination for those seeking a peaceful retreat in the lap of nature.

The next morning, we hired a taxi early and set off for Sariyatal from our hotel. On the way, we stopped at the Satyanarayan Temple on Kilbury Road, near the Himalayan Darshan Point. This vantage point offers breathtaking views of the Greater Himalayas, their peaks covered in snow. Witnessing this view in the early morning hours was both beautiful and mesmerizing.

We passed through Lover’s Point, where we enjoyed some local roadside delicacies—hot Maggie and tea—before continuing on to Sariyatal.

Sariyatal Lake is a crystal-clear body of water, with underwater flora and fauna clearly visible from above. Boating in the lake offers a unique experience, as the clarity of the water allows you to see the rich underwater life growing below the surface. The area also offers a variety of water sports and activities such as water zorbing, boating, rope cycling, zip-lining, and more.

Just before reaching Sariyatal, in Charkhet, is the Mountain Magin Adventure Park. This is an excellent place for those interested in adventure activities, with options for both kids and adults.

You can also visit the Woodland Waterfall, which is located about 1 km from the lake. This waterfall originates from Sariyatal Lake itself, adding to the area’s natural charm.
