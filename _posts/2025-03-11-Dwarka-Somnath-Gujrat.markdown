# **Journey**
Our journey started on the 12th of September, 2024, from Delhi. We were three friends traveling togetherâ€”two from Delhi and one who had flown in from Varanasi to join us at Delhi Airport. Our flight was scheduled for 3:30 PM, but it got delayed by about an hour. We had already arrived at the airport and were relaxing in the Encalm Lounge with my brother-in-law, who is an executive at Encalm Hospitality.

We reached Rajkot Airport around 6:30 PM and had to catch the Vande Bharat train from Rajkot Railway Junction at 9:00 PM. Rajkot Railway Station is about 25-30 km from the airport, so we hired a taxi and arrived at the railway station around 45 minutes early. Everyone was hungry, so we decided to grab some Gujarati delicacies outside the station to satisfy our hunger.

We boarded the Vande Bharat at 9:00 PM and arrived at Dwarka Junction around midnight. We checked into our hotel and went to sleep.

We stayed at VITS Devbhumi Hotel in Dwarka, which is a comfortable hotel to stay at. The Dwarkadish Temple's backside gate is about a 900-meter walk through narrow lanes from the hotel.

## 1. Dwarkadish
We took blessings from Lord Dwarkadish early the next morning. The Dwarkadish Temple is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites and an important place of worship for followers of Sanatan Dharma.

The temple is believed to have originally been built at the site where Lord Krishna established the city of Dwarka. According to Hindu texts, Krishna moved from Mathura to Dwarka primarily to protect his people from the repeated attacks of Jarasandha, the King of Magadh, who sought revenge for the killing of his son-in-law, Kamsa, by Krishna.

The Dwarkadish Temple in Dwarka was destroyed in 1473 by the Sultan of Gujarat, Mahmud Begada. He is believed to have attacked and demolished the temple as part of his military campaigns during his rule. Mahmud Begada was a ruler of the Sultanate of Gujarat, known for his attempts to expand his kingdom, which often included the destruction of Hindu temples and other cultural sites.

After the temple's destruction, the Dwarkadish Temple was later rebuilt by the Vijayanagara kings in the 15th century. The temple was reconstructed and restored to its former glory, and it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus today.

The temple features two significant gateways: Swarga Dwar (Gate to Heaven) and Moksha Dwar (Gate to Liberation).

## 12. Rukmani Temple
After taking blessings from Lord Krishna at the Dwarkadish Temple, we hired a cab to visit the Rukmini Temple, Bet Dwarka, and the Nageshwar Jyotirlinga.

The Rukmini Devi Temple in Dwarka, dedicated to Lord Krishna's beloved consort Rukmini, is a significant landmark located about 2 km from the Dwarkadish Temple. It lies on the route towards Bet Dwarka via Okha. The temple is believed to be more than 2500 years old, although the current structure likely dates back to the 12th century.

According to legend, once Rukmini and Krishna invited Guru Durvasa, a sage known for his short temper, to their palace for a meal. However, Guru Durvasa set a condition: he would only visit if Rukmini and Krishna themselves pulled his chariot to the venue. They agreed to this request.

As a queen, Rukmini was not accustomed to such physical labor, and after a while, she became thirsty. Krishna, understanding her discomfort, pressed his right toe onto the Earth. From the place where his toe touched the ground, the Ganga river emerged, and Rukmini quenched her thirst.

However, in her moment of relief, Rukmini forgot to offer the water to Guru Durvasa, which greatly angered him. In his rage, he cursed that Krishna and Rukmini would never be together. This is believed to be the reason the Rukmini Devi Temple is located away from Dwarka.

Additionally, Guru Durvasa cursed that Dwarka would always remain a barren land, incapable of supporting cultivation. This curse is said to still hold true today, as the land around Dwarka remains infertile, and the people of Dwarka cannot grow crops there.

The sweet water well that emerged from the spot where Krishna pressed his toe still exists in a nearby village. Unfortunately, we couldn't visit that place during our trip.

Rukmini is considered an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and is one of Krishna's principal queens.
