# **Journey**
Our journey started on the 12th of September, 2024, from Delhi. We were three friends traveling together—two from Delhi and one who had flown in from Varanasi to join us at Delhi Airport. Our flight was scheduled for 3:30 PM, but it got delayed by about an hour. We had already arrived at the airport and were relaxing in the Encalm Lounge with my brother-in-law, who is an executive at Encalm Hospitality.

We reached Rajkot Airport around 6:30 PM and had to catch the Vande Bharat train from Rajkot Railway Junction at 9:00 PM. Rajkot Railway Station is about 25-30 km from the airport, so we hired a taxi and arrived at the railway station around 45 minutes early. Everyone was hungry, so we decided to grab some Gujarati delicacies outside the station to satisfy our hunger.

We boarded the Vande Bharat at 9:00 PM and arrived at Dwarka Junction around midnight. We checked into our hotel and went to sleep.

We stayed at VITS Devbhumi Hotel in Dwarka, which is a comfortable hotel to stay at. The Dwarkadish Temple's backside gate is about a 900-meter walk through narrow lanes from the hotel.

## 1. Dwarkadish
We took blessings from Lord Dwarkadish early the next morning. The Dwarkadish Temple is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites and an important place of worship for followers of Sanatan Dharma.

The temple is believed to have originally been built at the site where Lord Krishna established the city of Dwarka. According to Hindu texts, Krishna moved from Mathura to Dwarka primarily to protect his people from the repeated attacks of Jarasandha, the King of Magadh, who sought revenge for the killing of his son-in-law, Kamsa, by Krishna.

The Dwarkadish Temple in Dwarka was destroyed in 1473 by the Sultan of Gujarat, Mahmud Begada. He is believed to have attacked and demolished the temple as part of his military campaigns during his rule. Mahmud Begada was a ruler of the Sultanate of Gujarat, known for his attempts to expand his kingdom, which often included the destruction of Hindu temples and other cultural sites.

After the temple's destruction, the Dwarkadish Temple was later rebuilt by the Vijayanagara kings in the 15th century. The temple was reconstructed and restored to its former glory, and it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus today.

The temple features two significant gateways: Swarga Dwar (Gate to Heaven) and Moksha Dwar (Gate to Liberation).

## 2. Rukmani Temple
After taking blessings from Lord Krishna at the Dwarkadish Temple, we hired a cab to visit the Rukmini Temple, Bet Dwarka, and the Nageshwar Jyotirlinga.

The Rukmini Devi Temple in Dwarka, dedicated to Lord Krishna's beloved consort Rukmini, is a significant landmark located about 2 km from the Dwarkadish Temple. It lies on the route towards Bet Dwarka via Okha. The temple is believed to be more than 2500 years old, although the current structure likely dates back to the 12th century.

According to legend, once Rukmini and Krishna invited Guru Durvasa, a sage known for his short temper, to their palace for a meal. However, Guru Durvasa set a condition: he would only visit if Rukmini and Krishna themselves pulled his chariot to the venue. They agreed to this request.

As a queen, Rukmini was not accustomed to sucRukminih physical labor, and after a while, she became thirsty. Krishna, understanding her discomfort, pressed his right toe onto the Earth. From the place where his toe touched the ground, the Ganga river emerged, and Rukmini quenched her thirst.

However, in her moment of relief, Rukmini forgot to offer the water to Guru Durvasa, which greatly angered him. In his rage, he cursed that Krishna and Rukmini would never be together. This is believed to be the reason the Rukmini Devi Temple is located away from Dwarka.

Additionally, Guru Durvasa cursed that Dwarka would always remain a barren land, incapable of supporting cultivation. This curse is said to still hold true today, as the land around Dwarka remains infertile, and the people of Dwarka cannot grow crops there.

The sweet water well that emerged from the spot where Krishna pressed his toe still exists in a nearby village. Unfortunately, we couldn't visit that place during our trip.

 Rukmani is considered an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and is one of Krishna's principal queens.

## 3. Bet Dwarka
On our way to Bet Dwarka, we passed through Mithapur, home to one of the largest Tata Chemicals plants, and the recently inaugurated Sudharshan Setu Bridge, which connects Okha and Bet Dwarka. The bridge, which opened to the public in February 2024, has significantly reduced travel time. Previously, travelers had to take a boat or ferry from Okha Port to reach Bet Dwarka.

Bet Dwarka, also known as Shankhodhar, holds immense religious and historical significance as the ancient port city and the believed residence of Lord Krishna. It is intricately linked to the story of Krishna and Sudama’s friendship. The name "Bet" is derived from the word "gift," symbolizing the gift Lord Krishna received from his friend Sudama. In the ancient epic Mahabharata, Bet Dwarka was referred to as ‘Antardvipa,’ and it was a place to which the Yadava clan had to travel by boat.

Explorations and excavations carried out beneath the sea have uncovered ancient settlements, some of which date back to the Harappan civilization and the Mauryan era, shedding light on the region’s long and rich history.

In addition to the main Krishna temple, Bet Dwarka houses several other temples dedicated to Hanuman, Vishnu, Shiva, Lakshmi Narayan, Jambavati, and Devi, making it a spiritual hub.

One of my friends on this trip has a close connection with one of the priests at the Bet Dwarka temple. Thanks to his connection, we were fortunate enough to gain access to each temple in the complex and receive blessings.

In the temple complex, there is a unique belief that visitors can donate rice or money, and in return, they receive a small portion of the rice to take home. The belief is that if you keep the rice in your kitchen, it will ensure that you never face scarcity of food in your home.



## 4. Nageshwar Jyotilinga
On our way back to Dwarka mainland from Bet Dwarka, we visited Nageshwar. To reach Nageshwar, you need to take a left turn from Mithapur, and it is only about 10-12 kilometers from Mithapur. Nageshwar is home to the tenth Jyotirlinga temple.

According to legend, a demon named Daruka imprisoned a Shiva devotee named Supriya in his city, Darukavana. Supriya's chants of "Om Namah Shivaya" invoked Lord Shiva, who defeated the demon. A self-manifested Shivalinga then appeared, which is now revered as the Nageshwar Jyotirlinga.

Inside the temple, there is a medium-sized Nageshwar Jyotirlinga. A silver snake is placed on top of the linga, which is always covered with a silver cloth, symbolizing the sanctity of the structure. Behind the linga, an idol of the Mother Goddess Parvati stands elegantly.  
We took blessings from Lord Shiva and performed a special darshan with Jal Abhishek. We were fortunate enough to get close to the Shiva Linga and carry out the Jal Abhishek. Since there weren't many devotees in the temple that day, we had the opportunity to spend a good amount of time exploring the temple complex as well.

## 5. Back to Dwarka
We arrived in Dwarka late in the afternoon and went straight to our hotel to rest. The distance from Nageshwar Jyotirlinga to Dwarka is only about 15-17 km, which takes roughly 30 minutes to cover.

In the evening, we visited the Dwarka Sunset Point, Lighthouse, and Bhadkeshwar Mahadev Temple, all situated along the stunning Arabian Sea coastline. The charm of the Sunset Point, the Lighthouse, and the Bhadkeshwar Mahadev Temple made the experience even more unforgettable. It’s easy to lose track of time as you sit there, mesmerized by the endless waves of the Arabian Sea crashing against the concrete barriers along the shore.

Later in the evening, we made our way to the Dwarkadish Temple, which is just about 1 km from the coastal attractions, to offer our prayers and seek blessings.

## 6. Road trip to Somnath
We woke up early the next morning, boarded our hired taxi, and left for Somnath. The journey took us along the coastal highway, NH 51, offering a glimpse of the endless Arabian Sea on one side. Passing through small fishing villages, the occasional flock of seabirds added to the charm. The contrast between the green land, salt-encrusted earth, and the blue sea is something you’ll find hard to forget.

Porbandar is approximately 110 km from Dwarka. We reached Dwarka and visited the Sudhama Temple, which is dedicated to Sudama, a poor Brahmin and a childhood friend of Lord Krishna. After that, we visited the Kirti Mandir, Gandhi’s birthplace. The interior of the building houses a variety of photographs, articles, and mementos from Gandhi’s life.

We then headed to Somnath, reached  there around the afternoon. After checking in at Hotel Sagar Darshan, a guesthouse managed by the Reliance Foundation, we were greeted with stunning views of the Arabian Sea. This hotel offers a spectacular view, and you can spend hours in the evening watching the tides and enjoying the magnificent sunset.

After freshening up, we headed straight to the Somnath Mahadev Darshan, which is just a walking distance from the hotel. We performed the Rudrabhishek in the old Somnath Temple, built by Rani Ahilya Bai Holkar, and then sought blessings from Mahadev in the main grand temple, which was built in the 1950s by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

In the evening, we spent hours at the coast of the Arabian Sea, marveling at the grandeur of the Somnath Temple. We clicked many breathtaking pictures of the temple and its surroundings.

Rani Ahilya Bai Holkar was a devoted follower of Lord Shiva. She believed in Shiva's benevolence and regarded him as the ultimate deity to guide and protect her and her kingdom. Her faith in Lord Shiva was an essential part of her identity as a ruler.

Ahilya Bai Holkar built and renovated several famous temples across India, including Somnath, Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Mahakaleshwar, and the Indore Shiva Temple, to name a few. One interesting aspect of her devotion to Shiva was that her official kingdom letters carried the Shiva symbol, and in her signature, she often used the phrase "Shiva Samrajya" to represent her reign.

## 6. Back to Rajkot via Tejpur.
We left early the next morning from Somnath in the hired taxi and headed towards Rajkot. We passed through Junagadh and made a brief stop in Tejpur, a garment industry town famous for its sarees. We bought some ladies' clothing there and then continued our journey towards Rajkot.

Our flight to Delhi was in the evening, but we reached Rajkot by the afternoon. We had lunch at a mall in Rajkot city and then boarded our flight back to Delhi.
