# **Journey**
Our journey began on the 22nd of May, 2024, from Delhi. We were a group of four friends—three from Delhi and one who had flown in from Varanasi to join us at Dehradun Airport.

We landed at Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun around 5:30 PM and hired a cab to Rishikesh, which is approximately 18–20 km from the airport. The drive took about an hour and a half, and we reached our hotel located in the Neelkanth area, just beyond Tapovan in Rishikesh. After checking in, we had dinner and called it a night.

The next morning, one of our friends suggested we try public transportation to reach Sonprayag. We headed to the Badrinath Highway, where buses to Sonprayag usually pass by. However, every bus we saw was already fully occupied from Rishikesh itself. We waited for 30 to 40 minutes, hoping to find vacant seats, but none were available. Eventually, we decided to return to the Rishikesh Bus Stand and try hiring a taxi or booking a bus from there.

By around 11:00 AM, we reached the bus stand and managed to hire a Maruti Ertiga for ₹5,500 to take us to Sirsi, near Sonprayag.  
The drive took approximately 7 hours. Along the way, we passed through some beautiful locations:  

Devprayag, a stunning spot where the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers merge to form the sacred River Ganga. The confluence of these rivers, with their distinctly colored waters, is a breathtaking sight and attracts many tourists.  

Srinagar, a major town in the Pauri Garhwal district, where the road runs parallel to the Alaknanda River.  

Rudraprayag, where the Mandakini River joins the Alaknanda. From here, the road follows the banks of the Mandakini River.  

We then continued our journey through Ukhimath and Guptkashi, eventually reaching our hotel in Sirsi, located near Phata in the Sonprayag region



# Dos and Dont's:    
    - Do book a hotel near the Rishikesh Bus Stand if you plan to travel by bus or want the  
        convenience of hiring a taxi on the spot. Alternatively, arrange a taxi in advance that  
        can pick you up directly from your hotel the next morning for Sonprayag.

    - Make sure to withdraw enough cash in Rishikesh for the rest of your journey, as ATMs may  
        be scarce or unreliable in the mountain regions


## 1. Sonprayag
We stayed at a hotel near Himalayan Heli Services in Sirsi, which we had booked in advance. After having dinner, we went straight to bed to get a few hours of sleep, as we had planned to leave the hotel by 3:30 AM the next morning to head towards Sonprayag.
we woke up around 3:00 AM, and it was raining heavily with loud thunder. We waited for the rain to ease a little before stepping out. By around 4:15 AM, we got into the pre-booked taxi that was waiting for us on the main road.

Sonprayag is approximately 7 km from Sirsi. On the way, we passed through the small towns of Rampur and Sitapur. When we arrived at Sonprayag, we were surprised to see how crowded it was that day. It took us nearly 30 minutes just to reach the designated drop-off point, located near the bus parking area, where the taxi had to return.

From the drop-off point, we began a 2.5 km walk, which took us nearly 2 hours due to the long queue of people that had started right from where the taxi dropped us off. We slowly made our way through the multi-storey parking area at Sonprayag, eventually reaching the Sonprayag–Gaurikund Jeep Stand.

Just before the jeep stand, there are registration counters where your Yatra registration is scanned. After completing the scan, we crossed a metal bridge over the Mandakini River and reached the jeep stand.

This is where a shuttle jeep service operates between Sonprayag and Gaurikund, covering a distance of about 4.5 km. The road is very narrow, and it’s common to experience traffic jams, especially when jeeps traveling in opposite directions have to make way for each other.


# Dos and Dont's:  
    - If you're planning to reach Kedarnath via trekking, it's highly recommended to book  
        your hotel near the Sonprayag Bus Stand or, even better, closer to the Gaurikund  
        Jeep Stand.
    - Doing so can save you 2–3 hours of travel time and spare you from a long and tiring  
        walk just to get to the starting point at Gaurikund.

## 2. Gaurikund
Gaurikund, named after Goddess Parvati (also known as Gauri), holds deep mythological and spiritual importance. According to Hindu beliefs, this is the sacred site where Parvati undertook intense penance (tapasya) to win the love and hand of Lord Shiva in marriage.

The area is home to the Gauri Devi Temple, a modest yet revered shrine dedicated to Goddess Parvati. Pilgrims often stop here to offer prayers before beginning their trek to Kedarnath.

Gaurikund was also known for its natural hot water spring, which served as a ritual bathing spot for devotees before commencing the yatra.
We reached Gaurikund around 8:00–8:15 AM. This is the last point before the trek to Kedarnath begins, so it's a good place to buy essential supplies such as medicines, rain gear, trekking sticks, and other necessities. You can also withdraw cash from the ATM here—if it’s working. It’s a great spot to prepare yourself for the actual trek ahead.

# Dos and Dont's:  
    - If you plan to trek to Kedarnath, try to book a hotel in Gaurikund itself and
        arrive at least one day before starting your trek. This will help you rest and  
        prepare properly for the journey ahead.


## 3. Kedarnath Trek
We began our trek from Gaurikund around 9:00 AM. As you ascend just 2–3 kilometers, on a clear and sunny day, the first glimpses of the snow-covered Kedarnath glaciers start to appear. The Mandakini River flows gracefully alongside the trail, and with every kilometer, you're greeted by the majestic mountains, cascading waterfalls, and breathtaking landscapes that make this journey truly enchanting.

Our first stop was at Jungle Chatti, roughly 3–4 kilometers from the starting point. We took a short break to rest, hydrate, and recharge ourselves with snacks and lemon drinks to maintain our energy levels.

The next major halt was at Rambara, where we stopped for lunch. From here, the terrain becomes significantly steeper, and you can see the trail winding up into cloud-covered peaks. At Rambara, you cross a metal bridge over the Mandakini River, marking the beginning of the most challenging stretch of the trek.

Just after this point, and a few steep switchbacks later, we reached Choti Lincholi. The climb from Choti Lincholi to Lincholi Top is arguably the toughest part of the trek. Along this stretch, the first views of the Kedarnath Base Camp come into sight—still distant but deeply motivating. We crossed patches of ice and glaciers, and despite the physical strain, the raw beauty of the Himalayas kept our spirits high. Between Choti Lincholi and Lincholi, it rained twice, and we had to quickly put on our raincoats.

As we neared Lincholi Top, one of our friends became so exhausted that he had to hire a horse to reach the Horse Camp near the Base Camp. Two of our other friends had fallen behind, so I decided to complete the final stretch alone.

I reached the Kedarnath Base Camp around 6:15 PM. One friend, who had arrived earlier on horseback, had already gone ahead to the Kedarnath Temple and was in the process of arranging a hotel room nearby. I initially waited at the base camp for my other two friends, who were still near Lincholi Top, but exhaustion was taking over.

My body was drained, and every part of me wanted rest—but something deep within urged me to keep going. The hotel was still 1.5 to 2 kilometers away from the base camp, situated just 50 meters from the temple. As soon as I started walking and caught the first full view of the Kedarnath Temple, surrounded by the endless beauty of the mountains, all my fatigue seemed to disappear.

I reached the temple stairs just in time for the Kedar Aarti at 7:00 PM. The enchanting chants, the sight of the temple glowing under the fading light, and the overwhelming presence of Lord Shiva made me feel like I had stepped into another world. Sitting there, clicking photos and capturing the divine atmosphere, I was overcome with emotion—I felt like crying and laughing at the same time. It was a moment of pure surrender, of connecting with something far greater than myself.

After about 10 minutes, I called the friend who had arranged our room. He was equally mesmerized by the temple's aura and was sipping tea at a nearby shop. Seeing me so worn out, he offered me his tea, saying I needed it more than he did.

We finally made our way to the hotel. The moment I entered the room, my body went into shock—not from illness, but from sheer exhaustion. I took a paracetamol and a muscle relaxant, collapsed onto the bed, and asked my friend to let me sleep undisturbed for a few hours. I told him to inform the others not to wake me up when they arrived. I needed rest—deep, healing rest—after one of the most challenging and unforgettable days of my life.
