# **Journey**
Our journey began on the 22nd of May, 2024, from Delhi. We were a group of four friends—three from Delhi and one who had flown in from Varanasi to join us at Dehradun Airport.

We landed at Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun around 5:30 PM and hired a cab to Rishikesh, which is approximately 18–20 km from the airport. The drive took about an hour and a half, and we reached our hotel located in the Neelkanth area, just beyond Tapovan in Rishikesh. After checking in, we had dinner and called it a night.

The next morning, one of our friends suggested we try public transportation to reach Sonprayag. We headed to the Badrinath Highway, where buses to Sonprayag usually pass by. However, every bus we saw was already fully occupied from Rishikesh itself. We waited for 30 to 40 minutes, hoping to find vacant seats, but none were available. Eventually, we decided to return to the Rishikesh Bus Stand and try hiring a taxi or booking a bus from there.

By around 11:00 AM, we reached the bus stand and managed to hire a Maruti Ertiga for ₹5,500 to take us to Sirsi, near Sonprayag.

The drive took approximately 7 hours. Along the way, we passed through some beautiful locations:

    - **Devprayag**, a stunning spot where the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers merge to form the sacred River Ganga. The confluence of these rivers, with their distinctly colored waters, is a breathtaking sight and attracts many tourists.

    - **Srinagar**, a major town in the Pauri Garhwal district, where the road runs parallel to the Alaknanda River.

    - **Rudraprayag**, where the Mandakini River joins the Alaknanda. From here, the road follows the banks of the Mandakini River.

    We then continued our journey through Ukhimath and Guptkashi, eventually reaching our hotel in Sirsi, located near Phata in the Sonprayag region

Dos and Dont's:
    - Do book a hotel near the Rishikesh Bus Stand if you plan to travel by bus or want the convenience of hiring a taxi on the spot. Alternatively, arrange a taxi in advance that can pick you up directly from your hotel the next morning for Sonprayag.

    - Make sure to withdraw enough cash in Rishikesh for the rest of your journey, as ATMs may be scarce or unreliable in the mountain regions


## 1. Sonprayag
We stayed at a hotel near Himalayan Heli Services in Sirsi, which we had booked in advance. After having dinner, we went straight to bed to get a few hours of sleep, as we had planned to leave the hotel by 3:30 AM the next morning to head towards Sonprayag.
we woke up around 3:00 AM, and it was raining heavily with loud thunder. We waited for the rain to ease a little before stepping out. By around 4:15 AM, we got into the pre-booked taxi that was waiting for us on the main road.

Sonprayag is approximately 7 km from Sirsi. On the way, we passed through the small towns of Rampur and Sitapur. When we arrived at Sonprayag, we were surprised to see how crowded it was that day. It took us nearly 30 minutes just to reach the designated drop-off point, located near the bus parking area, where the taxi had to return.

From the drop-off point, we began a 2.5 km walk, which took us nearly 2 hours due to the long queue of people that had started right from where the taxi dropped us off. We slowly made our way through the multi-storey parking area at Sonprayag, eventually reaching the Sonprayag–Gaurikund Jeep Stand.

Just before the jeep stand, there are registration counters where your Yatra registration is scanned. After completing the scan, we crossed a metal bridge over the Mandakini River and reached the jeep stand.

This is where a shuttle jeep service operates between Sonprayag and Gaurikund, covering a distance of about 4.5 km. The road is very narrow, and it’s common to experience traffic jams, especially when jeeps traveling in opposite directions have to make way for each other.


Dos and Dont's:
    - If you're planning to reach Kedarnath via trekking, it's highly recommended to book your hotel near the Sonprayag Bus Stand or, even better, closer to the Gaurikund Jeep Stand.
    -Doing so can save you 2–3 hours of travel time and spare you from a long and tiring walk just to get to the starting point at Gaurikund.

## 2. Gaurikund
Gaurikund, named after Goddess Parvati (also known as Gauri), holds deep mythological and spiritual importance. According to Hindu beliefs, this is the sacred site where Parvati undertook intense penance (tapasya) to win the love and hand of Lord Shiva in marriage.

The area is home to the Gauri Devi Temple, a modest yet revered shrine dedicated to Goddess Parvati. Pilgrims often stop here to offer prayers before beginning their trek to Kedarnath.

Gaurikund was also known for its natural hot water spring, which served as a ritual bathing spot for devotees before commencing the yatra.
We reached Gaurikund around 8:00–8:15 AM. This is the last point before the trek to Kedarnath begins, so it's a good place to buy essential supplies such as medicines, rain gear, trekking sticks, and other necessities. You can also withdraw cash from the ATM here—if it’s working. It’s a great spot to prepare yourself for the actual trek ahead.

Dos and Dont's:
    - If you plan to trek to Kedarnath, try to book a hotel in Gaurikund itself and arrive at least one day before starting your trek. This will help you rest and prepare properly for the journey ahead.


## 3. Kedarnath Trek
We started our trekking arpund 9AM from Gaurikund
