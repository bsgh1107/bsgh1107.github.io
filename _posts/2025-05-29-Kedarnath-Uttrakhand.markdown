# **Journey**
Our journey began on the 22nd of May, 2024, from Delhi. We were a group of four friends—three from Delhi and one who had flown in from Varanasi to join us at Dehradun Airport.

We landed at Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun around 5:30 PM and hired a cab to Rishikesh, which is approximately 18–20 km from the airport. The drive took about an hour and a half, and we reached our hotel located in the Neelkanth area, just beyond Tapovan in Rishikesh. After checking in, we had dinner and called it a night.

The next morning, one of our friends suggested we try public transportation to reach Sonprayag. We headed to the Badrinath Highway, where buses to Sonprayag usually pass by. However, every bus we saw was already fully occupied from Rishikesh itself. We waited for 30 to 40 minutes, hoping to find vacant seats, but none were available. Eventually, we decided to return to the Rishikesh Bus Stand and try hiring a taxi or booking a bus from there.

By around 11:00 AM, we reached the bus stand and managed to hire a Maruti Ertiga for ₹5,500 to take us to Sirsi, near Sonprayag.  
The drive took approximately 7 hours. Along the way, we passed through some beautiful locations:  

Devprayag, a stunning spot where the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers merge to form the sacred River Ganga. The confluence of these rivers, with their distinctly colored waters, is a breathtaking sight and attracts many tourists.  

Srinagar, a major town in the Pauri Garhwal district, where the road runs parallel to the Alaknanda River.  

Rudraprayag, where the Mandakini River joins the Alaknanda. From here, the road follows the banks of the Mandakini River.  

We then continued our journey through Ukhimath and Guptkashi, eventually reaching our hotel in Sirsi, located near Phata in the Sonprayag region

# Dos and Dont's:    
    - Do book a hotel near the Rishikesh Bus Stand if you plan to travel by bus or want the  
        convenience of hiring a taxi on the spot. Alternatively, arrange a taxi in advance  
        that can pick you up directly from your hotel the next morning for Sonprayag.

    - Make sure to withdraw enough cash in Rishikesh for the rest of your journey, as ATMs  
        may be scarce or unreliable in the mountain regions


## 1. Sonprayag
We stayed at a hotel near Himalayan Heli Services in Sirsi, which we had booked in advance. After having dinner, we went straight to bed to get a few hours of sleep, as we had planned to leave the hotel by 3:30 AM the next morning to head towards Sonprayag.
we woke up around 3:00 AM, and it was raining heavily with loud thunder. We waited for the rain to ease a little before stepping out. By around 4:15 AM, we got into the pre-booked taxi that was waiting for us on the main road.

Sonprayag is approximately 7 km from Sirsi. On the way, we passed through the small towns of Rampur and Sitapur. When we arrived at Sonprayag, we were surprised to see how crowded it was that day. It took us nearly 30 minutes just to reach the designated drop-off point, located near the bus parking area, where the taxi had to return.

From the drop-off point, we began a 2.5 km walk, which took us nearly 2 hours due to the long queue of people that had started right from where the taxi dropped us off. We slowly made our way through the multi-storey parking area at Sonprayag, eventually reaching the Sonprayag–Gaurikund Jeep Stand.

Just before the jeep stand, there are registration counters where your Yatra registration is scanned. After completing the scan, we crossed a metal bridge over the Mandakini River and reached the jeep stand.

This is where a shuttle jeep service operates between Sonprayag and Gaurikund, covering a distance of about 4.5 km. The road is very narrow, and it’s common to experience traffic jams, especially when jeeps traveling in opposite directions have to make way for each other.

# Dos and Dont's:  
    - If you're planning to reach Kedarnath via trekking, it's highly recommended to book  
        your hotel near the Sonprayag Bus Stand or, even better, closer to the Gaurikund  
        Jeep Stand.
    - Doing so can save you 2–3 hours of travel time and spare you from a long and tiring  
        walk just to get to the starting point at Gaurikund.



## 2. Gaurikund
Gaurikund, named after Goddess Parvati (also known as Gauri), holds deep mythological and spiritual importance. According to Hindu beliefs, this is the sacred site where Parvati undertook intense penance (tapasya) to win the love and hand of Lord Shiva in marriage.

The area is home to the Gauri Devi Temple, a modest yet revered shrine dedicated to Goddess Parvati. Pilgrims often stop here to offer prayers before beginning their trek to Kedarnath.

Gaurikund was also known for its natural hot water spring, which served as a ritual bathing spot for devotees before commencing the yatra.
We reached Gaurikund around 8:00–8:15 AM. This is the last point before the trek to Kedarnath begins, so it's a good place to buy essential supplies such as medicines, rain gear, trekking sticks, and other necessities. You can also withdraw cash from the ATM here—if it’s working. It’s a great spot to prepare yourself for the actual trek ahead.

# Dos and Dont's:  
    - If you plan to trek to Kedarnath, try to book a hotel in Gaurikund itself and
        arrive at least one day before starting your trek. This will help you rest and  
        prepare properly for the journey ahead.



## 3. Kedarnath Trek
We began our trek from Gaurikund around 9:00 AM. As you ascend just 2–3 kilometers, on a clear and sunny day, the first glimpses of the snow-covered Kedarnath glaciers start to appear. The Mandakini River flows gracefully alongside the trail, and with every kilometer, you're greeted by the majestic mountains, cascading waterfalls, and breathtaking landscapes that make this journey truly enchanting.

Our first stop was at Jungle Chatti, roughly 3–4 kilometers from the starting point. We took a short break to rest, hydrate, and recharge ourselves with snacks and lemon drinks to maintain our energy levels.

The next major halt was at Rambara, where we stopped for lunch. From here, the terrain becomes significantly steeper, and you can see the trail winding up into cloud-covered peaks. At Rambara, you cross a metal bridge over the Mandakini River, marking the beginning of the most challenging stretch of the trek.

Just after this point, and a few steep switchbacks later, we reached Choti Lincholi. The climb from Choti Lincholi to Lincholi Top is arguably the toughest part of the trek. Along this stretch, the first views of the Kedarnath Base Camp come into sight—still distant but deeply motivating. We crossed patches of ice and glaciers, and despite the physical strain, the raw beauty of the Himalayas kept our spirits high. Between Choti Lincholi and Lincholi, it rained twice, and we had to quickly put on our raincoats.

As we neared Lincholi Top, one of our friends became so exhausted that he had to hire a horse to reach the Horse Camp near the Base Camp. Two of our other friends had fallen behind, so I decided to complete the final stretch alone.

I reached the Kedarnath Base Camp around 6:15 PM. One friend, who had arrived earlier on horseback, had already gone ahead to the Kedarnath Temple and was in the process of arranging a hotel room nearby. I initially waited at the base camp for my other two friends, who were still near Lincholi Top, but exhaustion was taking over.

My body was drained, and every part of me wanted rest—but something deep within urged me to keep going. The hotel was still 1.5 to 2 kilometers away from the base camp, situated just 50 meters from the temple. As soon as I started walking and caught the first full view of the Kedarnath Temple, surrounded by the endless beauty of the mountains, all my fatigue seemed to disappear.

I reached the temple stairs just in time for the Kedar Aarti at 7:00 PM. The enchanting chants, the sight of the temple glowing under the fading light, and the overwhelming presence of Lord Shiva made me feel like I had stepped into another world. Sitting there, clicking photos and capturing the divine atmosphere, I was overcome with emotion—I felt like crying and laughing at the same time. It was a moment of pure surrender, of connecting with something far greater than myself.

After about 10 minutes, I called the friend who had arranged our room. He was equally mesmerized by the temple's aura and was sipping tea at a nearby shop. Seeing me so worn out, he offered me his tea, saying I needed it more than he did.

We finally made our way to the hotel. The moment I entered the room, my body went into shock—not from illness, but from sheer exhaustion. I took a paracetamol and a muscle relaxant, collapsed onto the bed, and asked my friend to let me sleep undisturbed for a few hours. I told him to inform the others not to wake me up when they arrived. I needed rest—deep, healing rest—after one of the most challenging and unforgettable days of my life.

# Dos and Dont's:  
    - Keep yourself hydrated all through the trek.
    - Carry the lightest luggage bas as much as possible.
    - Keep taking short breaks after every fewm meters and keep eating.
  

## 3. Kedarnath Temple Darshan
The Kedarnath Temple, nestled in the Himalayas of Uttarakhand, is one of the most sacred shrines in India, dedicated to Lord Shiva, the destroyer and transformer within the Hindu Trimurti. It is the highest located Jyotirlinga among the twelve Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva, revered deeply by millions of devotees.

According to legend, following the Mahabharata war, the Pandavas sought Lord Shiva’s forgiveness for the sins committed during the battle. Shiva, avoiding their plea, disguised himself as a bull. When the Pandavas recognized him, he attempted to vanish into the earth. Bhima managed to catch hold of the bull’s hump, which remained at Kedarnath, while the other body parts surfaced at four other locations—forming the sacred Panch Kedar circuit.

The present stone temple is believed to have been originally built by the Pandavas and later restored in the 8th century CE by Adi Shankaracharya, who is said to have attained mahasamadhi near the temple premises.

An awe-inspiring element near the temple is the Bhimshila, a massive boulder that, according to local belief, came rolling down during the catastrophic 2013 Uttarakhand floods and miraculously stopped just behind the temple, protecting it from destruction. The temple stood firm even as the surrounding area was devastated—deepening the faith in its divine protection and spiritual power.

The main door (mukhya dwar) of the Kedarnath Temple closes at 9:00 PM every night. However, a side entrance remains open and is used when the main door reopens at 4:00 AM for early morning darshan. Through this side door, sparsh darshan (touch darshan) is allowed for devotees who have arranged VIP entry passes, which cost around ₹1100.

We had pre-arranged a VIP Sparsh Darshan and joined the queue at around 11:00 PM. Inside the temple, we were accompanied by a priest (pandit) who guided us into the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) of the temple. There, we had the rare and divine opportunity to touch the sacred lingam of Baba Kedarnath and offer our prayers up close.

Inside the temple, just outside the sanctum, you can see statues of the five Pandavas and Draupadi, positioned as a mark of their devotion to Lord Shiva. After completing our sparsh darshan and paying our respects to Lord Shiva, we exited the sanctum. To the left of the garbhagriha, there is an idol of Goddess Parvati (Mata Amba), where we also offered our prayers and received blessings.

As we stepped out of the main temple, we noticed a stream flowing beneath the stone floor just behind the shrine—this is the Kedar Ganga, a sacred water stream believed to originate near the temple itself. Several sadhus (holy men) sat nearby, filling pots with the holy water for devotees to take home as prasad. We too filled the small bottles that came with our prasad packets with this sacred water, taking it back with us as a divine souvenir from our spiritual journey.

Since it was already late at night, we decided to rest and planned to explore the temple complex and nearby sacred sites early the next morning.

The next morning, we woke up early and visited the Bhimshila, located just behind the main Kedarnath temple. This massive boulder, believed to have miraculously saved the temple during the devastating 2013 floods, stands as a symbol of divine protection. We also took time to capture the serene beauty of the Kedar Valley on our phones. It was hard to say goodbye to such a divine environment, but it was time for us to begin our return journey to Sonprayag.

The previous night, we had already discussed the possibility of not trekking back on foot, given the exhaustion from the ascent. Though hiring horses was one option, I wasn’t fully convinced about taking that route either. So, we began exploring the possibility of arranging a helicopter ride back.

One of my friends, who had flown in from Varanasi, used his local contacts and, against all odds, managed to secure return helicopter tickets for us. It's important to mention that getting a helicopter ticket on the spot is extremely difficult, especially during peak season, but we were fortunate and grateful to have managed it through his network.

We waited near the helipad until around 2:00 PM, and finally boarded the helicopter. Within just 10 minutes, we were back in Sonprayag, skipping the long and tiring descent and ending our spiritual adventure on a note of awe and gratitude.

## 4. Journey back from Sonprayag to Rishikesh and then to Delhi.
We landed back at the Sonprayag helipad around 3:00 PM, where we took a short break, had some tea and snacks, and then hired an Ertiga taxi for ₹6,500 to return to Rishikesh. The journey took several hours, and we finally reached Rishikesh around 11:30 PM, checking into a hotel near Ram Jhula for the night.

The next morning, we boarded our pre-booked Zing Bus, reserved via RedBus, around 9:00 AM from the Zing Bus pickup point at Nepali Farm. By late afternoon, we arrived at Kashmiri Gate ISBT in Delhi, from where we took the metro to reach our respective homes—bringing our unforgettable Kedarnath yatra to a peaceful close.
