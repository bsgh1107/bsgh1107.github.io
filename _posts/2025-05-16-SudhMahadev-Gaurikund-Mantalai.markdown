# **Journey**
Jammu is my hometown, and I was visiting with my family to attend my cousin’s wedding in a village located about 22 kilometers from Jammu city. On the 5th of May, the Barat-wedding procession was scheduled to travel to Ramban, a small hill town situated beyond Udhampur and Patnitop.

Along with two of my cousins and my elder brother, I accompanied the Barat in a car from Jammu to Ramban. After the ceremonial dinner in Ramban was concluded, we decided to stay overnight in Patnitop, with plans to visit Sudhmahadev the following day. 


## 1. Patnitop
Patnitop is a scenic hill station located in the Udhampur district, in the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir. It lies on the National Highway 44 (formerly NH1A), between Udhampur and Ramban, making it a popular stopover for travelers heading toward Srinagar or exploring the Chenab Valley.  
Patnitop, nestled in the Shivalik belt of the Himalayas in Jammu and Kashmir, is a serene hill station known for its lush meadows, dense pine forests, and panoramic views of the snow-capped peaks.
We stayed overnight at Jai Shree Hotel and left early the next morning for Sudh Mahadev. This wasn’t my first visit to Patnitop—I’ve been there dozens of times before. As a result, we didn’t explore much this time, since our main purpose was to offer our obeisance to Lord Mahadev at Sudh Mahadev.

## 2. Gaurikund
Gaurikund derives its name from Goddess Parvati, consort of Lord Shiva. According to local legend, Parvati bathed in the spring here before worshipping Shiva at the nearby Sudh Mahadev Temple. The natural spring, known as Gaurikund, is believed to have been the bathing place of Goddess Parvati.

we reached Gaurikund passing through Kud, a place famous for Patisa and Choclate Burfi and took left from channani-Nashri newly built Tunnel and reached Gaurikund. thre are some 50-20 odd stairs we had to climb to reach the holy shrine.

## 3. Sudh Mahadev
Sudh Mahadev is dedicated to Lord Shiva. According to legend, a demon named Sudhant once attempted to attack Goddess Parvati while she was meditating at this site. In response, Lord Shiva hurled his trident (Trishul) to protect her, killing Sudhant on the spot.

However, as Sudhant was a devout Shiva follower and had acted unknowingly, Shiva forgave him and granted him salvation. In honor of his repentance, the place came to be known as Sudh Mahadev, meaning the purified (Sudh) form of Mahadev (Shiva).  
The origins of Sudh Mahadev date back over 3,000 years, making it one of the oldest Shiva temples in the region. It is believed that Goddess Parvati bathed at Gaurikund, approximately 10 km from Sudh Mahadev, before worshipping the Shivling here.

The temple enshrines a naturally black marble Shivling and a massive Trishul believed to be the same used by Lord Shiva. The continuous holy fire (Dhooni) nearby commemorates the presence of Baba Roop Nath, a great saint believed to have meditated here.

Historical records suggest that Raja Ram Chand of Chenani renovated the site and reinforced its sanctity during his rule in the 17th century. A sacred Saligrama (fossil stone associated with Vishnu worship) and artifacts were also found here and are revered to this day.

One of the most fascinating aspects of Sudh Mahadev’s Trishul is that, despite numerous efforts by researchers, its exact metallic composition remains unknown. Believed to be thousands of years old, this ancient weapon has withstood corrosion for centuries, enduring harsh weather and continuous handling without deterioration.

We reached the Sudh Mahadev temple around 8:30 AM after visiting Gaurikund. After offering our reverence to Lord Shiva, we spent some quiet time meditating within the peaceful temple complex. Just outside the temple, there is a small local market where we had breakfast. With a train to catch for Delhi later that evening, we then planned our return journey to Jammu.

## 4. Mantalai
Mantalai, located just a few kilometers from the Sudh Mahadev temple, is believed to be the birthplace of Goddess Parvati and holds immense spiritual significance. Surrounded by dense forests and scenic landscapes, this sacred site is also associated with the divine union of Lord Shiva and Parvati.

Unfortunately, due to a tight schedule, I couldn’t visit Mantalai this time. However, I definitely plan to explore it during my next trip and delve deeper into its rich mythology and serene beauty.
