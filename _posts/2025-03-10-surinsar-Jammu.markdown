It was my maternal cousin's wedding, and I had to attend the ceremony, as it was the last wedding in my aunt's direct family. The event took place in a village about 22 kilometers from Jammu City.

This quaint and beautiful village is named Aithem, and it used to be my home around 25 years ago. I spent the first 10-12 years of my life there.

I arrived in Aithem on the 10th of May, 2022, along with one of my cousins who lives in Jammu City. After spending a few hours at the wedding home, I realized there wasnâ€™t much to do, so my two cousins and I decided to take a trip to a beautiful spot located 7 kilometers from the village.

This magnificent place is known as Surinsar. Surinsar is approximately 30 kilometers from the Panjthirthi area of Jammu City. You can reach it by hiring a private taxi, driving your own vehicle, or using public transport from the Panjthirthi Bus Stand. The journey typically takes about 1 to 1.5 hours, depending on the mode of transport.
