It was my maternal cousin's wedding, and I had to attend the ceremony, as it was the last wedding in my aunt's direct family. The event took place in a village about 22 kilometers from Jammu City.

This quaint and beautiful village is named Aithem, and it used to be my home around 25 years ago. I spent the first 10-12 years of my life there.

I arrived in Aithem on the 10th of May, 2022, along with one of my cousins who lives in Jammu City. After spending a few hours at the wedding home, I realized there wasn’t much to do, so my two cousins and I decided to take a trip to a beautiful spot located 7 kilometers from the village.

This magnificent place is known as Surinsar. Surinsar is approximately 30 kilometers from the Panjthirthi area of Jammu City. You can reach it by hiring a private taxi, driving your own vehicle, or using public transport from the Panjthirthi Bus Stand. The journey typically takes about 1 to 1.5 hours, depending on the mode of transport.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`2022-05-14-Surinsar Lake, Jammu.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
