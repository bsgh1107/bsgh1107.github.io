It was my maternal cousin's wedding, and I had to attend the ceremony, as it was the last wedding in my aunt's direct family. The event took place in a village about 22 kilometers from Jammu City.

This quaint and beautiful village is named Aithem, and it used to be my home around 25 years ago. I spent the first 10-12 years of my life there.

I arrived in Aithem on the 10th of May, 2022, along with one of my cousins who lives in Jammu City. After spending a few hours at the wedding home, I realized there wasnâ€™t much to do, so my two cousins and I decided to take a trip to a beautiful spot located 7 kilometers from the village.

This magnificent place is known as Surinsar. Surinsar is approximately 30 kilometers from the Panjthirthi area of Jammu City. You can reach it by hiring a private taxi, driving your own vehicle, or using public transport from the Panjthirthi Bus Stand. The journey typically takes about 1 to 1.5 hours, depending on the mode of transport.

On the way to Surinsar, there are numerous breathtaking hill viewpoints where you can stop, enjoy a plate of Maggi at local joints, and take in the enchanting natural beauty. One of the most famous viewpoints is Aithem Paragliding Point. If you're an adventure enthusiast, you can pause your journey and try paragliding, provided the activity is available that day, as it doesn't operate on a regular schedule. The paragliding take-off point requires a short trek of about 300 meters to reach the hilltop, while the landing point is a sandy bed along the Sardan Stream.

When you reach Surinsar, you'll be greeted by a beautiful lake surrounded by hills and lush green landscapes, developed by the Surinsar-Mansar Tourism Development Authority, Jammu.

Surinsar Lake is one of the twin lakes in Jammu, with Mansar Lake being the other, located about 15 km away. The lake is encircled by thick mangroves, pine trees, and stunning hills.

At the center of the lake lies an island, known as "Breti" to the locals. This island is home to thousands of bats and migratory birds that visit seasonally. There's a small Nag Dev (Snake God) temple on the island, and locals believe that many snakes can be found if you get too close or put your feet near the island. In the past, a narrow strip of land once connected the island to the mainland, but over time, it has been submerged in the lake. If you take a boat ride close to the island, you can easily spot this submerged strip of land beneath the water.

The mythological history of Surinsar dates back to the Mahabharata. According to legend, Babruvahana, the brave son of Pandava warrior Arjuna, fought a battle with his father and defeated him. Unaware that Arjuna was his father, Babruvahana learned from his mother, Ulupi (daughter of the Serpent King), that the arrow he had shot had struck none other than his own father. To heal Arjuna, Lord Krishna advised Babruvahana to bring a "Mani" from "Patal Lok" (the underworld). Babruvahana shot an arrow at Surangsar (now Surinsar), fought a battle with the Nagas, and secured the Mani. To return, he shot another arrow from "Patal Lok," which emerged at Mansar (present-day Mansar). Over time, these two passages created in the earth filled with water and eventually became the Surinsar and Mansar lakes.

Some locals believe, based on stories passed down through generations, that there was once a direct passage between Surinsar and Mansar. They recall hearing the sound of crinkling payals (anklets) as a large snake traveled between the two lakes on special occasions like Nag Panchami. However, this phenomenon is said to have ceased in the last 50 to 100 years.

I recently visited Surinsar with my two cousins. Although I had been here many times before, this visit felt special. I noticed significant development in the area, with beautiful green parks, well-maintained footpaths around the lake, and a variety of adventure activities like wall climbing and rope climbing.

This was also the first time I had the opportunity to go boating on Surinsar Lake. The boatman, a local resident, took us very close to "Breti," the small island in the middle of the lake. We saw thousands of bats hanging from the trees in the daylight, and the chirping of countless other birds made me feel like I had entered a bird sanctuary. The entire experience of approaching the island was captivating.

For just 10 rupees, you can buy a ball of wheat flour dough and feed it to the fish and turtles in the lake. When you throw a piece of dough into the shallow waters, hundreds of fish will quickly gather around it. If you're lucky, you might even spot turtles and other aquatic creatures joining in.

You should also try fetching water from the well near the Surinsar Main Market to quench your thirst. The water is incredibly sweet and rich in natural minerals. Many people stop there just to taste this refreshing water.
